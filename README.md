# Selenium-Pinterest-Parser
Selenium Pinterest parser with simple interface

(Files in the master branch)

To run the program you need:

- pip install selenium, fake-useragent, tkinter

1. Download the webdriver that matches your version of Google to the project folder. (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
2. In the "tok" file, enter the path to the webdriver, login and password from Pinterest.
3. Next, a window will open in which you can enter the number of images you wish to download.
4. Press the "Начать" button.
5. Wait.

P.S. The commented code is a function to move, rename, and change the format of all downloaded images to JPG. You can customize it for yourself.

P. S. #2. In Google settings, change the folder of downloaded files to the desired one so that the images are not downloaded to the Downloads folder.

P. S. #3. Also, for convenience, I have a telegram bot that receives all downloaded images and allows you to filter them, but I did not add it, since it is easily created.
