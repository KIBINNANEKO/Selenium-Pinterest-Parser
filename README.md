# Selenium-Pinterest-Parser
Selenium Pinterest parser with simple interface

To run the program you need:

1. Download the webdriver that matches your version of Google to the project folder. (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
2. In the "tok" file, enter the path to the webdriver, login and password from Pinterest.
3. Next, a window will open in which you can enter the number of images you wish to download.
4. Press the "Начать" button
5. Wait

P.S. The commented code is a function to move, rename, and change the format of all downloaded images to JPG. You can customize it for yourself.

P. S. #2. In Google settings, change the folder of downloaded files to the desired one so that the images are not downloaded to the Downloads folder.
